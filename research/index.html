<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>This paper demonstrates how to build an automatic tracking system based on vision methods. The system has successfully been used on robots made by YSU-Eagle. In the past, the operators needed to control the rotational movement of robots’ gimbal units by themselves, which led to poor performance of firing due to large delay of image transmission. In this paper, I build a system which can free operators from this hard task.The system runs on Ubuntu operating system and OpenCV has been installed on it. With the industrial camera fixed on the gun, the system could read image in real time and use image analysis method to find armors. Then, if there is any armor in this image, it uses PnP algorithm to calculate the three-dimensional coordinates in the camera coordinate system and then turns them into the pitch&amp;yaw angles. This algorithm needs to know the true size of the armor and the pixel coordinates of each corners of the armor. Besides, the
system has taken bullet’s falling into consideration. Based on the model of bullet’s falling, the system adds some compensation value to the pitch&amp;yaw angles. This system is mainly compiled by C++ programming language, including vision algorithm codes and serial communication codes. In addition, because it runs on Ubuntu operating system, there are some scripts written in shell programming language to automatically manage this system, including the compiling links of C++ programming language and start-up program. During real operating test, the frame rate can reach 130 FPS and that satisfies the actual needs.</p>

<strong><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home?preview=MCM2019.pdf">Get out of the Louvre(2019MCM)</a></strong><br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>This paper studies how to evacuate a large number of tourists in the Louvre safely and quickly. Considering the Louvre’s architectural structure and tourist types, a multi-floor building evacuation model based on improved cellular automata theory was established. The queuing theory was used to obtain the shortest evacuation time. Then the gradient threshold was used to determine the opening time and number of the extra emergency exits, and finally the dynamic evacuation model is used to establish the evacuation model of tourists under risk.
We have established a multi-floor building tourists evacuation model(Model 1)
based on the cellular automata theory to solve the problem. Assuming that in the
event of an emergency, the tourists use only four main entrances as escape exits,
and the evacuation goal is for the last four tourists who choose the four different
exits respectively to leave their chosen target exits at the same time. According to the shortest path principle, the evacuation time is 407.5s, and the results obtained by queuing theory optimization are the same for each exit.</p>

<strong>Some other research topics including robotics, control and computer vision.</strong><br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Control: </i><br /><i> A wind panel control device: </i>This device performs PID feedback through the angle of the wind panel to control the motors on both sides. It allows the panel to be in any position while maintain or rotate it at a constant speed.<br />
<i> A plate-ball control system: </i>This device recognizes the black ball with the camera above the plate and transmits the position information to the control system below. The control system then adjusts the pitch angle of the plate by two motors to move the ball across the plate according to the programmed movement trajectory.<br />
<i> A single inverted pendulum system: </i> Based on the mechanical model of the inverted pendulum, the DC motor and speed reducer on the frame are PID controlled according to the pendulum angle. When the end of the bar is kept vertical, the rotating rod is made to rotate in uniform or variable velocity.

<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Robotics&amp;Computer vision: </i><br /><i> Robomaster: </i> RoboMaster is one of the world's leading robotics competition. Each team has to design and build a squad of multi-purpose robots that are capable of completing special tasks as well as skirmish combats. As the chief engineer of the team YSU Eagle, I designed the visual components that auto-lock on the weak points of enemy armor in real time through the implementation of the binocular stereo vision algorithm. The system feedbacks three-dimensional coordinates of the enemy targets to the STM32 control system, then automatically adjusts the turrets for the optimal firing angle. However, due to the enormous amount of visual processing power needed for this component, our old microcontroller system simply could not support it. Therefore, I upgraded it to the Intel NUC7i7DNHE as the visual processing control system and running the Ubuntu 16.04 operating system on it. I programmed the system with C++ and implemented OpenCV 3.4.1 Open Source Computer Vision Library. Later on, I further improved the computational efficiency with multi-thread programming  technology, so that the binocular range finding algorithm could reach 50FPS (frame rate) and met all the requirements. After this upgrade, our operator no longer needs to worry about targeting and could focus more on maneuvering the robot.<br />
